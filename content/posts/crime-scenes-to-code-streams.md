## Forensics to Computer Science

As a cop, I spent some time in forensics and digital forensics. I enjoyed the work. Policing is messy, dirty, often smelly, sometimes violent, and very fluid. 

On the other hand, forensics is... Okay, it's also messy, dirty, and often smelly. But it is rigorous. It is a technician's and an applied scientist's realm. There is a beauty in that. It was also a completely different orientation within the policing domain.

I retrained as a software engineer and got to work building full-stack solutions for enterprises. This new career is surprisingly similar to software engineering. Objectives are contested, shifting, and unclear. Timelines are tight. Resources are limited. There are thick books about the rules. But they are surprisingly vague and open to interpretation. Sometimes, they are silent about the problem at hand. 

So we figure it out, patch things together, and develop hacks to get the best result for everyone involved. And hope nothing breaks and nobody dies. 

Nobody has been hauled off in cuffs in my software career so far, though. I have yet to pepper spray anyone at work. So that's a change.

## Falling for Applied Science Again

Recently, I started some very humble work in experimental computer science. I have some theories about text tokenizers to test. So, off I go. Create the hypotheses. Define the metrics and thresholds. Set up the experimental apparatus. Run the tests. Keep detailed notes. Learn, iterate. 

I used dry and wet chemicals, fume hoods, vacuum chambers, lasers, and UV lights in forensics. Now, I write code. It is much cleaner, and nothing smells.

But the feeling is the same. The feeling of re-orientation and perspective shift concerning software is much like the shift from investigations to forensics in policing.

It's a different kind of software work. It's a beautiful thing.
