## It Started Innocently Enough

Transparently, it started as a portfolio project. I wanted to build a portfolio project so that I'd be ready if my employment situation changed. I wanted to consolidate what I've learned in the last few years, push my skills into new areas, and dig into gaps. I wanted to grow into a machine learning engineer and be a strong Ph.D. applicant when I finish my master's.

I have an excellent career coach, Carly Taylor, at [Rebel Data Science](https://www.rebeldatascience.com/). She challenged my initial portfolio plan (a bunch of small demonstrations of concept mastery) and encouraged me to think more broadly. Then I came across a YouTube video by the guys at [Taro](https://jointaro.com) (I forget which one) where they made an interesting point. What's better than a portfolio project? A portfolio project with users. It took a while to land on an idea, but when I did...

Well, things got out of hand quickly. ðŸ˜†

## Techcrafting AI

Earlier this year, I was admitted to the University of York's MSc. in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. To get ready, I decided to dive into the research to get up to speed. I took all the AI and robotics courses I could in my undergrad, but then I spent the next trail running like a maniac. I like the mountains.

I took the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera. I earned the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate). And I started reading papers. Lots of papers.

The problem is there is _so much_ research coming out every day in AI it's impossible to keep up. I didn't want to focus on foundations to the exclusion of the latest research. But seriously, it's unbelievable. Each week in mid-2023, over 1000 AI/ML papers are published on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). That's nuts. I had to find a way to keep up, even with just the summaries.

The field is exploding. There are so many new ideas and so much innovation. Things are going from research to product in the blink of an eye. And people had questions. Friends, family, and co-workers had questions about what was happening. Heck, I had questions.

But in moments I had the time to sit down read research summaries deeply, I need to be reading things like [The 100 Page Machine Learning Book](https://themlbook.com/), books that advance my core skillset in software engineering like [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), _or writing lots of code_.

My solution was to turn arXiv research summaries into podcasts. I could listen to them while I was trail running, driving, or doing chores. And I could share them with others. I could share them with you. That seemed like a win. Then, I could focus on the things that were most important to me.

That's how the [TechcraftingAI LLM](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/brad-edwards7) (55 episodes), [TechcraftingAI Computer Vision](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/brad-edwards24) (38), and [TechcraftingAI Robotics](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/brad-edwards1) (23 episodes) podcasts started. Listening to [AWS Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) read research summaries is something I do for several hours a day, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. And sometimes, I wanted links to papers I heard so I could read them.

So, I turned the summaries into newsletters. That's how I started the [TechcraftingAI LLM](https://www.linkedin.com/build-relation/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7114658433022259200) and [TechcraftingAI Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/build-relation/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7122964022873784320) newsletters got started on LinkedIn. These are all daily, or at least as daily as arXiv summaries are available. There is a gap on the weekend and catch up on Tuesdays.

I also write the [TechcraftingAI](https://www.linkedin.com/build-relation/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7093747007571308544) newsletter once or twice a week. It's about whatever I happen to be learning in AI at the time, mainly a review of the latest research in the field.

## An Automation Portfolio Project

So. Making the daily podcasts and newsletters is time-consuming. It's that boring, repetitive kind of work I shouldn't be doing before coffee each morning. But people find the podcasts and newsletters useful (like me!), so I wanted to keep it up. The newsletters have about 300 subscribers. The podcasts... Well, like I said, it's niche. But I have a solid dozen listeners, and I guarantee none of them are my mom. ðŸ˜†

So, what does a software engineer do? Automates the shizzle out things. I wrote a Jupyter notebook that scrapes arXiv for summaries, creates scripts and newsletters with links, and generates audio with Polly. I hit run, it does its thing. I use [Claude 2](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2) to generate a list of themes for each day's research. I do the last mile, copy-paste and publish, because Spotify and LinkedIn don't allow submission by API (I don't blame them! I wouldn't either). It could be better, but it's pretty good. And it's a lot better than doing it all by hand.

Next step: portfolio project! Write a fully automated pipeline that does everything, from ingestion to publishing. That would make a great portfolio project! It requires all kinds of skills, from DevOps, to full-stack development, prompt engineering, and product management. And it serves real users.

## Research Matters - Portfolio Projects Don't

But it's not enough. The podcasts and newsletters are a great start. But I've realized over the last couple of months that I have a deep passion for learning and research. I want to understand, and I want to help others understand. I hate seeing people's work and time go to waste. Amazing ideas that could make a huge difference in our lives are getting lost in the churn. I want to change that.

So, I'm taking TechcraftingAI to another level. I am creating an intelligent open science platform that uses AI to accelerate and share AI research. I'm calling it AtomikLabs. It will offer services and tools to help people keep up with the latest and greatest, organize their research, and even give research assistance.

So, my portfolio project is taking on a life of its own. But that's a good thing. It means I'm doing something I care about and something I can see making a difference.

I can't ask for more than that from a portfolio project. ðŸ˜‰
